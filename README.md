Nice 👌 — you already have a solid project description. The goal of your GitHub README is to make it:

1. **Clear** (what the project does)
2. **Reproducible** (how to run it)
3. **Safe** (make sure users know to use *their own* DB credentials, not yours)

Here’s a professional template you can adapt:

## ⚙️ Setup & Run

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/student-management.git
cd student-management
```

### 2. Configure Database

* Create a PostgreSQL database (example: `studentdb`).
* Update your **local `db.properties` file** (this file is ignored in git, you must create it yourself):

```properties
db.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/studentdb
db.username=your_username
db.password=your_password
```

⚠️ **Important:** Replace `your_username` and `your_password` with your own PostgreSQL credentials. Do **not** commit real credentials to GitHub.

### 3. Build & Run

```bash
mvn clean install
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.yourpackage.Main"
```

## 📖 Example Menu (Console Output)
